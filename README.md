🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

    Git
    Terraform
    Docker
    Kubernetes
    AWS CLI

    docker build -t shopx-frontend ./src/frontend  
    docker build -t shopx-backend ./src/backend  

### 🏗️ How to Run the Project
🌐 Step 1: Provision Cloud Infrastructure

Run Terraform to set up cloud resources:
```
terraform apply -auto-approve  
```

### 🛠️ Step 2: Deploy Kubernetes Services

Apply Kubernetes deployment files:
```
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/deployment.yaml  
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/service.yaml  
```

🔄 Step 3: Set Up CI/CD Pipelines

    GitLab CI: Use ci-cd/gitlab-ci.yml.
    Jenkins: Use ci-cd/Jenkinsfile.

### 📈 Step 4: Configure Monitoring

Set up Prometheus and Grafana with:
```
kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus.yml  
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json  
```

🤖 Step 5: Automate with Scripts

Use automation scripts:
```
bash scripts/setup.sh  
bash scripts/clean.sh  
```
🔧 Terraform Setup

    Define your cloud resources in main.tf.
    Provision resources like VPCs, subnets, and load balancers.

🛡️ Security

    IAM Roles: Secure AWS resources with appropriate roles.
    TLS: Implement secure communications.
    Docker Security: Scan images for vulnerabilities.
