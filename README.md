# Scalable E-Commerce Platform with Modern DevOps Practices

This project aims to create a scalable e-commerce platform named **ShopX** by implementing advanced DevOps practices. The platform is built with a modern cloud infrastructure, container orchestration, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), observability, and security practices.

## Overview

The **ShopX** platform consists of:

- **Frontend**: A user-facing application built using Angular or React.
- **Backend**: An API service built using Node.js or C# .NET Core.
- **Database**: A relational database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- **Infrastructure**: Managed in the cloud using AWS or Azure with Terraform.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes is used to manage the deployment and scaling of services.
- **CI/CD**: Pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.
- **Monitoring**: Datadog, Prometheus, and Grafana are used for observability.

This project follows best practices for infrastructure as code (IaC), containerization, CI/CD, and monitoring.

Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

    Git
    Terraform
    Docker
    Kubernetes
    AWS CLI
    Helm
    CI/CD Tool (GitLab CI / Jenkins) (optional, depending on your choice)
    Prometheus
    Grafana

Installation

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scalable-ecommerce-platform.git
cd scalable-ecommerce-platform

    Set up AWS credentials:

Ensure you have your AWS credentials set up either through the AWS CLI or environment variables. If using the AWS CLI:

aws configure

    Install Terraform Providers:

Navigate to the infrastructure/terraform directory and initialize Terraform.

cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init

    Configure Kubernetes Cluster (Optional):

Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up. You can use AWS EKS or Azure AKS, or set up a local cluster using Minikube or Docker Desktop.

kubectl config use-context <your-cluster-context>

    Build Docker Images:

Build the Docker images for both the frontend and backend.

docker build -t shopx-frontend ./src/frontend
docker build -t shopx-backend ./src/backend

How to Run the Project
Step 1: Run Terraform to provision the cloud infrastructure

Navigate to the terraform directory and run:

terraform apply -auto-approve

This will provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS or Azure.
Step 2: Set up Kubernetes

Deploy the frontend and backend services to Kubernetes.

    Create Kubernetes deployments and services using kubectl.

kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f infrastructure/kubernetes/service.yaml

Step 3: CI/CD Pipelines

Set up your CI/CD pipeline in either GitLab CI or Jenkins. Here are the steps to create a pipeline:

    GitLab CI Example:

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the ci-cd directory. This pipeline will:

    Build Docker images for both frontend and backend.
    Run tests.
    Deploy the services to Kubernetes.

    Jenkins Example:

Create a Jenkinsfile in the ci-cd directory. This file will define your build, test, and deploy steps.
Step 4: Monitor the Application

Set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the Kubernetes cluster and services.

    Prometheus will scrape metrics from your services and provide time-series data.
    Grafana will visualize the metrics and provide dashboards.

Deploy the configurations by applying the prometheus.yml and grafana-dashboard.json files.

kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus.yml
kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json

Step 5: Automate with Scripts

Use the scripts/setup.sh to automate the setup process or scripts/clean.sh to clean up resources.

bash scripts/setup.sh
bash scripts/clean.sh

Terraform Setup

    Configure your AWS provider in main.tf.
    Run terraform apply to provision the infrastructure.

For example, the main.tf file includes the configuration for:

    VPC and Subnets
    Kubernetes Cluster (EKS or AKS)
    Load Balancer

Kubernetes Setup

    Use Helm charts to manage your Kubernetes deployments.
    Create deployments and services for the frontend and backend in infrastructure/kubernetes/deployment.yaml and service.yaml.

CI/CD Setup

Configure your CI/CD tool:

    GitLab CI: Define the pipeline in ci-cd/gitlab-ci.yml.
    Jenkins: Use ci-cd/jenkinsfile for pipeline configuration.

Monitoring Setup

    Prometheus: Collect metrics and push them to Grafana.
    Grafana: Visualize the metrics in a user-friendly dashboard.

Security

    IAM Roles: Make sure you configure AWS IAM roles correctly for security.
    TLS: Secure your application using TLS certificates.
    Docker Security: Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
